Data
-- Change the data model to match your needs
-- Data is fed into the app via the attached CSV files
-- DataManager.swift contains all of the data handling other than CSVImport.swift (requires CSVImporter.framework and HandySwift.framework). Links to online CSV files are in the DataManager to allow online updates.
-- Recommendation: Use Google Sheets to generate your data and set the sheet to automatically publish a CSV to the web. Copy that link into the app and download it as a CSV to include as the offline version.
-- There is more to know, but you will need to play around with the DataManager file to figure it all out. Email me if you have specific questions: cole.denkensohn@usuhs.edu
